       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>India is one of the largest tea producers in the world, with over 70% of domestic tea 
        being consumed within India itself. in india we call it as <em>chai</em> this is the most
        loved drink of the people in Indian nation. people in india believes that tea have 
        some healing powers too accorting to their ayurveda.</p>

        <p>The origin of chai dates back more than 5,000 years, when a king in what is now 
        India ordered a healing spiced beverage be created for use in Ayurveda, 
        a traditional medicinal practice in which herbs and spices are used for healing.
         A variety of indigenous spices would be used to prepare the healing drink depending on the region 
         of the continent or even the neighborhood where the beverage was being made.</p>

         <p> you’re not sipping chai at someone’s home in India, you’re likely sipping it on a street corner. 
            Chai “wallahs” are Indian chai makers that sit, stand, or set up shop with their chai-making gear 
            on nearly every street corner in nearly every town in India, from big cities to desert outposts. 
            (Think of how many Starbucks you see in a day in your own town and multiply that by 100 and 
            you’ll get an idea of how many chai wallahs set up “shop” in India.) Each chai wallah may have 
            his or her own style of brewing and spicing the chai they make and most prepare chai in small 
            batches to order.</p>
